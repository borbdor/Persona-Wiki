            <p>
                <strong>Persona 5</strong> is a 2016 role-playing video game developed by P-Studio and published by <strong>Atlus</strong> 
                The game is the sixth installment in the Persona series, itself a part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. 
                It was released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017. 
                It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America, and by Deep Silver in PAL territories. 
                An enhanced version featuring new content, Persona 5 Royal, was released for PlayStation 4 in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020. 
                It was published by Atlus in Japan and worldwide by its parent company Sega. 
                Persona 5 Royal was later released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in October 2022.
            </p>

            <P>
                Taking place in modern-day Tokyo, the story follows a high school student known by the codename Joker who transfers to a new school after he is 
                framed for assault and put on probation. Over the course of a school year, he and other students awaken to a special power, 
                becoming a group of secret vigilantes known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born 
                rom humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults and change their hearts. As with previous 
                ames in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as Personas. 
                The game incorporates role-playing and dungeon crawling elements alongside social simulation scenarios.
            </P>

            <P>
                Persona 5 was developed by P-Studio, an internal development division within Atlus led at the time by game director and 
                producer Katsura Hashino. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier Persona games included character designer 
                Shigenori Soejima and music composer Shoji Meguro. Preparatory work began during the development of Persona 4, with 
                full development beginning after the release of Catherine in 2011. First announced in 2013, Persona 5 was delayed from 
                its original late 2014 release date due to being unfinished. Its themes revolve around attaining freedom from the limitations 
                of modern society: the story was strongly inspired by picaresque fiction, and the party's Personas were based on literary outlaws and rebels.

            </figure>


            <p>
                Persona 5 combines a stylish turn-based JRPG battle system with
                daily-life simulation. During the day you attend school, work part-time
                jobs and build Confidant relationships. At night you infiltrate
                <strong>Palaces</strong>, dungeons created from distorted desires, or
                explore the randomly generated Mementos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Combat revolves around exploiting elemental weaknesses with skills and
                guns. Knocking down all enemies allows a <strong>Hold Up</strong>,
                leading either to negotiations for Personas and items or an
                <strong>All-Out Attack</strong> that deals huge damage. The series’ UI
                reaches a new level of style, with menus, transitions and victory screens
                animated like a comic book.

            <h2 id="p5-ui">Iconic User Interface Design</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most recognizable elements of <strong>Persona 5</strong> is its 
                revolutionary <strong>user interface (UI) design</strong>. Unlike most JRPGs 
                that aim for minimalism or transparency, Persona 5 embraces a bold, 
                stylish, rebellious visual identity that perfectly reflects the theme of the 
                <em>Phantom Thieves</em>. Every menu, transition, and visual element 
                carries a sense of motion and attitude, giving the interface itself a 
                “character-like” personality.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="kepek/persona5menu1.gif" alt="Persona 5 stylish UI animation" class="full-image">
                <figcaption>Persona 5’s dynamic menu transitions—sharp, fast, and full of personality.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                The game uses a striking combination of <strong>red, black, and white</strong>, 
                inspired by punk and graphic street art. Menu selections expand in sharp, 
                jagged comic-book-inspired shapes, text shifts with exaggerated motion, 
                and character art slides in with a dramatic cutout effect. The interface feels 
                alive: buttons bounce with anticipation, selections “snap” into place, and 
                every animation reinforces the game's youthful, rebellious tone.
            </p>

                <figcaption>The Persona 5 command UI—energetic typography and comic-style flair.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Persona 5’s UI became so influential that it set a new industry standard. 
                Its bold use of <strong>kinetic typography, asymmetrical layouts, and layered motion</strong> 
                has been widely praised as one of the best UI designs in gaming history. 
                Even routine actions—opening a menu, checking stats, starting combat—feel 
                exciting thanks to the game’s commitment to style.

            </figure>

            <p>
                <strong>Persona 5 Royal</strong> is an expanded version of the base game,
                adding new characters, mechanics, locations and an entire extra story
                arc. While the core plot of Joker and the Phantom Thieves remains, Royal
                explores new themes of truth, happiness and the ethics of changing
                reality itself.
            </p>


            <p>Gameplay and Exploration Enhancements in royal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>New Location and Activities:</strong> The new explorable area of Kichijoji offers 
                    several new hangout spots, including a jazz club (which can boost party 
                    member stats), a billiards lounge (improves Baton Pass effectiveness), 
                    and a clothing store.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mementos Overhaul:</strong> The sprawling Mementos dungeon features an added NPC named Jose, 
                    new music tracks, and collectibles (flowers and stamps) that can be traded to permanently 
                    increase XP, money, or item drop rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grappling Hook:</strong> A new grappling hook mechanic has been added, allowing Joker to access previously 
                    unreachable areas within Palaces and discover hidden treasures and paths.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Thieves Den:</strong> A new in-game hub area where players can display achievements, listen to music, view concept art, 
                    and play a new card game called Tycoon with party members.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quality-of-Life Improvements:</strong> Numerous changes make the daily life aspect of the game more flexible. This includes 
                    more opportunities for activities at night (even after exploring the Metaverse), more voiced dialogue, and a "Speed Reader"
                    book to finish other books faster.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Combat and Dungeon changes in royal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Baton Pass Buffs:</strong> The Baton Pass mechanic is available from the start of the game and can be leveled up to provide health 
                    and SP recovery, making it a vital part of combat strategy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Showtime Attacks:</strong> Powerful, stylish two-person tag-team special attacks are unlocked as the story progresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Will Seeds:</strong> Three collectible "Will Seeds" are hidden in each Palace. Collecting all three provides a unique, powerful accessory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reworked Boss Fights</strong> All major Palace bosses feature new mechanics and phases, offering a fresh challenge for returning players.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fusion Alarms</strong> A random event in the Velvet Room that, when managed carefully, allows for the creation of Personas with enhanced stats or unique skills. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Showtime attacks like the one above are completely new to Royal and are
                not present in the original Persona 5. They give characters flashy,
                context-sensitive finishing moves that can turn a battle around.

            </figure>

            <p>Royal adds several important characters and Confidants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kasumi Yoshizawa</strong>, (ont the left) a new first-year gymnast at Shujin Academy who joins the Phantom Thieves as a party member later in the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Takuto Maruki</strong>, a school counselor hired after the first Palace incident, providing Joker with useful Confidant abilities 
                    and serving as the primary antagonist for the new semester.</li>
                <li>An expanded <strong>Confidant</strong> route for <strong>Goro Akechi</strong> (on the right),
                    revealing more about his motivations and relationship with Joker.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These additions deepen the emotional core of the story and create new
                bonds that directly tie into the finale of Royal.
            </p>

            <h3 id="p5-royal-third-semester">The Third Semester</h3>

            <figure>

            </figure>

            <p>
                One of Royal’s biggest changes is the completely new
                <strong>third semester</strong>, a story arc that takes place after the
                events of the original game would normally end. Here, the Phantom Thieves
                face a reality where everyone’s personal tragedies seem to have been
                “fixed”, but at a cost.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                The third semester includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A brand new Palace with its own puzzles, Shadows and boss.</li>
                <li>Additional Social Link scenes and endings.</li>
                <li>New music tracks and animated cutscenes that reframe the overall
                    message of the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Because of this extended ending, Royal is generally considered the
                definitive story experience for Persona 5.

            </figure>

            <p>
                <strong>Persona 5 Strikers</strong> is a major spin-off that continues the
                story of the Phantom Thieves after the events of Persona 5. Developed in
                collaboration with Omega Force, it mixes the stylish world of Persona
                with fast-paced, real-time combat across several Japanese cities during a
                summer road trip.
            </p>

            <h3 id="p5-strikers-gameplay">Gameplay – Action RPG meets Persona</h3>

            <figure>
                <img src="kepek/p5strikersgameplay.gif" alt="Persona 5 Strikers gameplay screenshot" class="full-image">
                <figcaption>Strikers blends Musou-style action with Persona’s weakness system.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Unlike the strictly turn-based mainline games, Strikers plays like an
                <strong>action RPG</strong>. Battles take place in real time with
                combos, dodges and special attacks. However, it still preserves core
                Persona mechanics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enemies have elemental weaknesses that you exploit with Persona skills.</li>
                <li>You can pause time to select spells in a radial menu, keeping a
                    tactical layer on top of the action.</li>
                <li>All Phantom Thieves are playable, each with unique movesets and Personas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This makes Strikers a rare hybrid: it feels like a Musou-style game with
                large groups of enemies, but it is structured more like a traditional JRPG
                with dungeons, story chapters and character progression rather than
                pure stage-based missions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because it directly follows up the story of Persona 5 (or Royal, in
                spirit), many fans consider Strikers an unofficial “sequel” that gives
                the Phantom Thieves one more grand adventure.
