            <p>
                <strong>Persona 4</strong> is a <strong>2008 role-playing video game by Atlus</strong>. It is chronologically the fifth installment 
            in the Persona series, itself a part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise, and was released for the 
            PlayStation 2 in <strong>Japan in July 2008</strong>, <strong>North America in December 2008,</strong> and in <strong>Europe and Australia in March 2009,</strong> 
            being one of the final major exclusives for the system. It was re-released as a PlayStation 2 Classic for the PlayStation 3 
            in April 2014. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Persona 4 takes place in a fictional Japanese countryside and is indirectly related to earlier Persona games. 
                The player-named protagonist is a high-school student who moves into the countryside town of Inaba from the city for a year. 
                uring his year-long stay, he becomes involved in investigating mysterious murders with a group of friends while harnessing the
                power to summon physical manifestations of their psyches known as a Persona.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plot of <strong>Persona 4</strong> was inspired by the work of mystery novelists owing to its murder mystery premise. 
                The rural setting was based on a town on the outskirts of Mount Fuji and intended as a <em>"'nowhere' place"</em> and 
                is the central setting to have players sympathize with the daily life of the characters. The developers added 
                many in-game events to prevent the game from becoming stale.
            </p>
            <p>
                During localization, numerous alterations to Japanese
                cultural references were made to preserve the effect as much as possible. The release of Persona 4 in Japan was accompanied 
                by merchandise such as character costumes and accessories. The game's music was primarily composed by <strong>Shoji Meguro</strong>, with vocals 
                performed by <strong>Shihoko Hirata</strong>. The Western releases came with a soundtrack CD with selected music from the game.
